# ESP32 T-Display S3 AMOLED project template

## Description

This is a project template to create microcontroller apps with automatized firmware builds for [esp32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32), [esp32s2](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-s2) and [esp32s3](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-s3) microcontroller boards. It uses for that [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and [platformio](https://platformio.org/).


## Requirements

- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
- [platformio](https://platformio.org/)
- [python](https://www.python.org/)


## GitHub Actions - Workflow

The release build happens in the `build & release` workflow: [build_release.yml](.github/workflows/build_release.yml).
It creates a release, after creation of a new git tag (named it like `v1.0.0`).

If you want to test the build on all merge w/o creating a tag then the `build` workflow is what you looking for: [build.yml](.github/workflows/build.yml)


## PlatformIO

[PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) is a tool to create microcontroller apps for arduino platforms and compatibles (esp32). You can install the [Visual Studio Code extension](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode) in the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) IDE.


## Python

There is a tiny python script needed to customize the firmware filenames within platformio, see documentation: https://docs.platformio.org/en/stable/scripting/examples/custom_program_name.html

The [extra_script.py](extra_script.py) script gets the platformio env (e.g. lolin32) and the git-tag for the firmware filename.
This is required to publish several firmware names in the github artifacts of a release.

## CHANGELOG

You can write your changes in the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) before you create a release. It will be shown under the release page.

## Example Release

see [Releases](https://github.com/mcuw/esp-ghbuild-template/releases) on the right sidemenu.

## Usage

Use this repository as a template for your own esp32 repository. You can reduce and adapt your required boards in the [platformio.ini](platformio.ini). Update the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) file before you are creating a new release. When you create a new git tag then a new release will always includes  generated firmwares.
